Observations
Based on data - Capomulin and Ramicane reduces the size of tumors better.

There is a strong positive correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume shown in the correlation graph. This means when the mouse weight increases the average tumor volume also increases.

Capomulin was the maximum administered drug regimen.
